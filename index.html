      <h1 class="text">My role in this Project</h1>
      <p>As the Designer in our Team, I am responsible for creating the design and layout of the web pages in our Project.
          My job is to produce sample designs, then demonstrate and receive feedback about them from my team members.
          With this feedback then taken into consideration, run it with our Technical Expert, Ethan, to eventually produce a final design. <br><br>

          The next step was to think about how these designs could be implemented by exploring with the CSS styling, which I could then 
          pass onto our developers, Samiul and Abdi, who incorporated these ideas within the development of our Project.   <br><br>
          
          Whilst drafting designs, it was very crucial that I focus on the UX of our web pages as we wanted to make our Project
          usable, enjoyable and accessible for every user.

      <h1 class="text">About Me</h1>
      <p>Growing up, the concept of computers never ceased to leave me astounded. Today, we substantially rely on technology to 
          endeavour and advance in fields such as script writing, artificial intelligence and programming to make our lives easier. 
          What first sparked my curiosity in the world of Computer Science was when I achieved a certificate for my award-winning 
          Scratch game all the way back in year 5 - I was captivated by how the simple combination of words and letters could develop 
          into such extraordinary digital animations and stories. This experience led me to study the subject as one of my GCSE's, where 
          I discovered the true beauty of the Von Neumann architecture. It was then that I had recognised not only my hunger for broadening 
          my discoveries but also my desire to become involved in the prodigious workings that go on behind the scenes. 

          <br><br>

        My curiosity inspired me to progress onto A-Level Computing which advanced my knowledge of databases, programming and algorithms 
        inputting them into real life problems. By using these skills, I built an organised, easy-to-use IT room booking system via Python, 
        attempting to correct the flaws with the situation at my Sixth Form as my A-Level Project. Towards the end of my Project, I realised 
	that I did not just want to stop it there; I knew that I wanted to continue learning Computer Science, hence why you're reading this
	right now. This triggered my curiosity in Development, where I have an interest to pursue my career in and tackle the 
	underrepresentation of women within the tech workforce, currently only 
        comprising 28.8% of those in the industry.
